# Retro Game Hub Website Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a website that emulates the user interface of a transparent handheld gaming device. The website will feature a personalized greeting, a display of recently played games (though this will be simplified in this version), and a "Retro Game Folder" section (which will be the main game grid). The aesthetic will be retro and immersive.  The site will allow users to select and launch games.

## Visual Style and Vibe

*   **Retro-Futurism:**  A blend of retro gaming aesthetics (pixel art, 8-bit color palette) with a modern, clean design.
*   **Transparency:**  Extensive use of transparency to mimic the transparent casing of a handheld device.
*   **Rounded Corners:**  Rounded corners on all elements.
*   **Layered Design:**  Elements should appear to float.
*   **Color Palette:**  Primarily dark, with strategic pops of vibrant, retro colors.
*   **Typography:**  A clean, sans-serif font for general UI, and a pixelated font for game titles.

## Key Features

*   **Personalized Greeting:**  A greeting in the "status bar."
*   **Game Grid:**  A responsive grid displaying game cards.
*   **Game Cards:**  Each card represents a game.
*   **Game Launch:** Clicking a game card opens the game in a modal.
*   **Game Overlay/Modal:**  A dedicated area for the game.
*   **Responsive Design:**  Adapts to different screen sizes.
